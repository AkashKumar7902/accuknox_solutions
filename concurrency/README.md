    cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
    for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
        go func() {
            for f := range cnp {
                f()
            }
        }()

<h4>what the following code is attempting to do?</h4>

This code demonstrates the concept of goroutines and channels in Go for concurrent programming. It creates a pool of worker goroutines (4 in this case) using a for loop. Each goroutine waits for functions to be sent through the buffered channel. Only one function literal (`func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }`) is sent to the channel. However, since the channel is buffered, it can hold more functions, and the worker goroutines are still waiting.

<h4>What is the significance of the for loop with 4 iterations?</h4>

The for loop creates four goroutines, allowing concurrent execution of the anonymous function that listens for functions from the channel. This concurrency potentially speeds up the execution of the code as each goroutine can handle processing independently.

<h4>What is the significance of make(chan func(), 10)?</h4>

The `make` function initializes the channel `cnp` with a buffer size of 10. The buffer allows the sender to continue sending values (functions in this case) without waiting for the receiver to be ready to receive them. This can increase the throughput of the program by decoupling the sender and receiver, allowing the sender to continue producing values even if the receiver is temporarily busy.

<h4>Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?</h4>

Since it's a buffered channel, `cnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }` did not wait for the reciever to be ready and proceeds to the next executable line i.e., `fmt.Println("Hello")`. Since the program doesn't wait for the goroutines to process the function from the channel, it exits before the goroutines have a chance to execute the function and print "HERE1".

if the channel was not buffered, then the sender and reciever must both be ready, else `cnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }` would wait indefinetly. we can say that, non buffered channels provide synchronization. 

Possible solutions for "HERE1" to be printed are:

1. Use of unbuffered channel.
2. Introduction of a delay or synchronization mechanism, such as a wait group or a sleep statement.

<h4>Giving use-cases of what these constructs could be used for.</h4>

1. **Processing large datasets in parallel**: Split the data into smaller chunks and send them as functions to be processed by worker goroutines concurrently.

2. **Handling network requests asynchronously**: Create a pool of worker goroutines to handle incoming requests without blocking the main thread.

3. Performing background tasks or long-running computations without hindering the responsiveness of the main application
